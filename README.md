# hangman_ose

Final assignment for a school project.  This is a hangman in Icelandic with a few Icelandic words.
In the drawer menu you can read about the game and there is another game were you can guess a few
Icelandic proverbs.  The game is in Icelandic and the proverbs are in Icelandic.
On the home screen there is a new random joke in Icelandic that refreshes every time you restart the app.
Here are some example photos:
